Create a login/logout/signup registration with a database using Django

1. Create a main folder -> "Loging:Logout" #main directory that contains my project
2. Virtual environment
-> python -m venv "name of virtual environement" #to isolate the dependencies of my project, so that they don't interfere with other projects
-> source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Django in venv
-> pip install django
-> pip install django_cripy_forms #adds additional styling for forms
4. Create project
-> django-admin startproject "name of project" (in this case = myproject)
5. Create app
-> cd myproject
-> python manage.py startapp "name of app" (in this case = users) #handles user functions -> login, logout, signup

6. install the created app in the project
-> settings.py in myproject
-> Under INSTALLED_APPS add: 'users.apps.UsersConfig',
    'crispy_forms',

7. import http response -> views.py in the app
from django.http import HttpResponse
def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("<h1>Home</h1>")
#views handle what my website shows when someone visits a specific page
#so i'm creating a view for the homepage of my website
#so, right now my method is defined as such: when someone visits my homepage, show them a heading that says "Home"

8. add "include" in urls.py and add new path
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('users.urls'))
]
#urlpatterms is like a list of directions for different parts of my website
#the first path says: if someone goes to "/admin/" in my website's address, they'll see the django admin panel
#the second path says: if someone goes to my website's main address, it tells the website to look in the "users" app 

9. Copy #8 
and create a new python file in the app called urls.py and paste it
Only keept this:

from django.urls import path
#import views
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home)
]
#seting up directions within a specific part of my website
#from . import views gets the instructions(views) from a file called views.py in the same place
#if someone goes to the main address of the "users" section, this says to show what's in the 'home' part of the views.py

10.  
-> cd myproject
#run a development server
-> python manage.py runserver

11. in urls.py in app, create a name 
urlpatterns = [
   path('', views.home, name ='home')
]

12. Use the advanced way for http response in views.py
def home(request):
    return render(request, 'users/home.html')

13. create folder in users app called templates and then create a folder within the templates folder called users and create a file called "home.html", "signup.html", "login/html"

In home.html -> create the  3 buttons

14. setttings.py -> TEMPLATES -> 'DIRS': ["templates"],

#The rest you've implemented

15. Creating superuser
-> python manage.py createsuperuser
